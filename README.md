## Project background
### Embracing Building in Public
The concept of "Building in Public" has seen its popularity surge among tech communities, yet it remains a novel approach in broader business contexts. Originating from the democratization of technology (highlighted by the rise of low-code platforms and the journeys of solo founders), alongside the evolution of social media (transforming personal networks into expansive communities), this philosophy leverages the foundational role of "community" in product and solution development. While pinpointing its inception is challenging, the mid-2010s witnessed pioneers like Pieter Levels and companies such as Buffer and Gumroad embracing this ethos, rooted in principles as old as the internet itself.

Open source and "building in public" are united by their commitment to collaborative creation and the pursuit of common benefits. This focus on transparency and collective input tends to yield solutions of superior quality and wider applicability, validating the power of collective wisdom over solitary expertise. That's what The Guild and North Star firmly believe.

### The Guild's Rebranding Journey Begins
The Guild, with its foundational commitment to open source, is now embarking on a rebranding journey reflective of these principles. As a beacon in the software development community and a staunch advocate for GraphQL and open source, our rebranding initiative is an opportunity to embody the "building in public" philosophy. This approach, while innovative, challenges conventional branding practices. 

Traditionally, branding processes have been conducted behind closed doors, often to protect proprietary strategies and innovations. Despite a few brands like Mozilla attempting to demystify their processes, the norm remains internal deliberations culminating in a grand reveal. However, in the spirit of exploration and in recognition of the digital age’s value on transparency, we see a unique opportunity to open up these processes.

We approach this not as a critique of traditional methods but out of curiosity and a belief in the potential for a more inclusive process. It's about augmenting, not diminishing, the creativity and expertise that professional agencies and consultants bring to the table.

In an age where community engagement and transparency are paramount, concealing branding endeavors is a missed opportunity for deeper connection and collaboration.


### An Invitation to Collaborate
This rebranding journey for The Guild, facilitated by North Star, is an open invitation to The Guild's community and the wider public. We believe that by embracing a collaborative approach, we can craft a brand identity that resonates more deeply with everyone involved. Your insights, feedback, and participation are invaluable to this process.
